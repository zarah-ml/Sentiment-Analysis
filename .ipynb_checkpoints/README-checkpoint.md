# Sentiment Analysis Using AWS SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker has built-in algorithms that let you quickly get started on extracting value out of your data. In this repo I have used the Blazingtext that provides highly optimized implementations of the Word2vec and text classification algorithms. BlazingText's implementation of the supervised multi-class, multi-label text classification algorithm extends the fastText text classifier to use GPU acceleration with custom CUDA. Blazingtext's supervised algorithm has been used to perform sentiment analysis.
